July 2020 - generated clean code for GCC, including secure extension routines

July 2020 - added unpolarized options (returns average of TE and TM)

Mar 2018 - added -ve to vary energy in eV for AgI lab calculations

June 2017 - fixed problem with next token after "-lambda 633" dumped on command line.

Feb 2015 - added '%' as a comment identifier for sample files

Feb 2015
   Modified the sample scanning routine to permit specification of units
   in the film thickness.  
    air
    c-Si 10 um doping=1E19
    c-Si
   Similarly allowed on command line arguments except there is no optional
   space before the unit.
     tfoc -sample simple.sam -lambda 0.00106cm -thickness 1 100000A

   Added ability to have a mixture of materials.  This is specified in the
   layers as 
     [ {SERIES | PARALLEL | MAXWELL-GARNETT | BRUGGEMAN} 0.8 SiO2 0.2 Si3N4 ]
   where the first item is optional and specifies the mixing model to be used
   for the effective medium approximation, followed by a structure consisting
   of mixed 80% SiO2 and 20% Si3N4.

   The models are:
       SERIES          - index is just weighted average of the index terms
       PARALLEL        - index is weighted sum of inverse index terms
       LOOYENGA        - Symmetric weighted sum of eps^1/3.
       MAXWELL-GARNETT - Maxwell-Garnett valid only for 2 components.  The
                         small volume fraction is taken as the inclusion
       BRUGGEMAN       - Symmetric.  Although expression is valid for an
                         arbitrary number of components, exact value only
                         derived for two components.

   Multiple complex structures can be written recursively.
     [ 0.8 [ 0.2 SiO2 c-Si 0.8 ] 0.2 Si3N4 ]
   specifies a layer of 80% mixture of (20% SiO2 / 80% c-Si) with 20% of Si3N4

May 2009:
   The free carrier absorption is now limited to an alpha of 3E4, which
   for CO2 gives a reflectivity of 10-11% at high temperature from an
   undoped sample.  Need some sort of experimental data to validate 
   these values in reality.
